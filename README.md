# Music-Player
Music Player in HTML CSS &amp; JavaScrip <br> <br>
I have created Music Player with several features like loop, repeat or shuffle a song, play/pause or play the next or previous song. You can view the songs list and also know which song is currently playing and you can also select the song from the list to play.
